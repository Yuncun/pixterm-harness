description: Remove the omakase harness from the current repo — uninstall the git hooks, delete exactly the untracked files init placed (never a tracked file), and strip the omakase block from .git/info/exclude, restoring the repo to its pre-init state. Use when asked to "remove / uninstall omakase", "take the harness off", or "undo init".

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/remove/run.sh"

On Copilot CLI or a plain shell, run this skill directory's `run.sh`.

Uninstalls the git hooks, deletes exactly the untracked files init placed (never a tracked
file), and strips the omakase block from `.git/info/exclude`. Confirm to the user that the
working tree is back to its pre-init state. Tracked files are never touched.
