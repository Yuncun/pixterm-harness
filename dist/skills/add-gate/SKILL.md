description: Wire a tool, skill, or check to run on a git hook as an omakase gate. Use when asked to "add a gate", "attach/wire a tool or skill to a hook", "run X on pre-commit/pre-push", "gate on a linter/test/reviewer", or "make sure X runs before commit/push". Covers picking the flags, the pre-flight checks that decide whether a third-party tool can even be gated, and the wiring. Run from a harness clone (it edits payload/), not an adopter repo.

# /add-gate — attach a tool to a git hook

You are editing a **custom harness** (a clone of omakase-harness or your own harness
repo), adding a gate to its `payload/`. You are NOT editing an installed
overlay — edits to an injected copy are overwritten on the next `init`. Confirm you are in
the harness repo (it has `payload/` and `omakase.manifest`); if you are in an adopter repo,
stop and switch to the harness clone first.

A **gate** is a check wired into a git hook (pre-commit or pre-push) via `omakase-gate.sh`.
Pick the flags **before** writing anything; most mistakes come from picking the wrong combination.

## Step 1 — pick the flags by asking (don't guess)

Work out the flags with the user, one question at a time, multiple-choice where you can. Do
not move on until the answer is clear. Three questions settle the flag set:

1. **What are you gating, and on which event?** The tool / skill / command, and whether it
   fires on pre-commit or pre-push. (Slow checks belong on pre-push.)
2. **Can it run inline every time, or is it expensive or out-of-band?**
   - Runs fast and deterministically inline, exits with a real code (a linter, a compiler,
     a test suite): no extra flag needed.
   - Runs inline but is slow enough that re-running on every commit wastes time: add
     `--cacheable` (the result is reused for the same commit once it passes).
   - Cannot run inside a hook at all (slow, non-deterministic, or requires human/agent
     judgment): add `--cacheable` plus a blocking step that refuses the push; the check
     runs out of band, then records its result with `omakase-gate.sh <name> --record`.
3. **Does it only apply to some paths?** If yes, add `--glob '<space-separated-globs>'`; the
   gate is skipped when no changed file matches.

Read the flag set back in one line and confirm before wiring. Example: *"Pre-push, blocking
step + `--cacheable` (out-of-band judgment), `--glob 'src/**'`. Wiring it?"*

## Step 2 — pre-flight a third-party tool (the part people skip)

Before wiring a tool you do not own (a marketplace skill, a creator's skill, a CLI), check
all five. A "no" on 1–3 usually means the tool **cannot** be a gate as-is: change the
approach or the tool, do not force it.

1. **Agent-invocable non-interactively?** Some skills are interactive-only or set
   `disable-model-invocation: true`. If a job can't drive it headlessly, it can't be a
   gate. (This is why the Anthropic code-review plugin can't be a gate here.)
2. **Emits a machine verdict, or only a human report?** A `--step` blocks on a non-zero
   exit, so it needs an exit code or a parseable result. If the tool only writes prose,
   either (a) use the out-of-band pattern (a blocking step an agent or human clears with
   `--record` after reading the findings), or (b) have the step apply *its own* thin
   pass/fail rule, and don't pretend the tool emits one it doesn't.
3. **Does its output path work in THIS repo?** A reviewer that posts to GitHub is inert in an
   Azure-DevOps repo; a check that needs a service you don't run is dead. Confirm the result
   actually lands somewhere usable here.
4. **Deterministic and fast enough to run inline every time?** Decides the flags: yes → `--step`
   alone; slow but runnable → add `--cacheable`; can't run in a hook → `--cacheable` + a
   blocking step cleared out of band with `--record`.
5. **Safe to depend on, with an off-switch?** You will DEPEND on it, not copy it (see Step 3).
   Make sure it has an escape hatch and won't wedge a commit.

## Step 3 — wire it

**Depend, don't copy.** Install/keep the tool as a dependency and invoke it. Never paste a
third-party tool's files into `payload/` — you own the threshold, not the tool.

Add a job in `payload/lefthook-local.yml`:

```yaml
pre-commit:            # or pre-push
  jobs:
    - name: <name>
      run: bash .omakase/bin/omakase-gate.sh <name> --step '<your command>'
      # add --cacheable if the step is expensive (reuses a pass for the same commit)
      # add --glob '<pats>' if the gate applies only to some paths
```

For a check that cannot run inside a hook (out-of-band review, LLM judgment): use a blocking
step that always refuses, add `--cacheable` so a recorded pass unblocks the re-push, and run
`omakase-gate.sh <name> --record` out of band (from the job or skill that ran the actual
check) once the check passes.

```yaml
pre-push:
  jobs:
    - name: <name>
      run: bash .omakase/bin/omakase-gate.sh <name> --cacheable --step 'echo "run the <name> job first, then push" && exit 1'
      # add --glob '<pats>' if the gate applies only to some paths
```

The per-gate escape hatch is `OMAKASE_SKIP_<NAME>=1` (name upper-cased, `-`→`_`), audited in
the run ledger.

## Step 4 — prove it fires

Test before you publish. In a throwaway repo, inject the payload, then make a change that
should trip the gate and one that shouldn't:

```bash
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && git init -q && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init
OMAKASE_PAYLOAD=<your>/payload bash <base-harness>/bin/init.sh
# inline gate: stage a violating file, attempt commit, see it block, fix, see it pass.
# out-of-band gate: touch a matching file, attempt push -> blocked (step exits non-zero);
#   run the check and omakase-gate.sh <name> --record; attempt push -> allowed.
OMAKASE_PAYLOAD=<your>/payload bash <base-harness>/bin/remove.sh    # reset
```

Then, if the harness lists its gates in a guard table (README / docs), add the new one there;
and for `--source` harnesses, leave `omakase.manifest` alone unless the gate needs a new
`recommends:`.
