usage: init.sh [<owner/repo[#ref]> | --source <git-url|path>] [--cut-over] [--help]

Overlay payload/ into the current repo additively (zero committed footprint) and
install lefthook hooks. A payload path the repo already COMMITS is never touched:
it is skipped and reported.

  <owner/repo[#ref]>
               shorthand for --source https://github.com/owner/repo (optionally pinned to a
               branch or tag with #ref). This is the shareable install line: a harness
               published at github.com/you/harness installs with `init you/harness`.
  --source <git-url|path>
               pull a harness SOURCE — a git repo carrying a payload/ tree plus an
               omakase.manifest (flat key: value; name required, version + recommends optional) —
               into a local cache (${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/omakase/sources) and inject
               the base harness's payload with the source's payload layered ON TOP (base
               machinery underneath, source wins on overlap), so a source ships only its
               delta and relies on base machinery without keeping its own copy. The source is
               remembered; a later bare init.sh refreshes and re-injects the same source.
  --cut-over   also untrack (git rm --cached) every payload path the repo currently
               commits, so the injected copies take over. With --source this is the MERGED
               base+source set, not only the source delta (a --source install equals a
               built bundle). This STAGES DELETIONS of
               shared files; the next commit applies them for everyone. It prints
               exactly what it will untrack and the consequences, then REFUSES
               unless OMAKASE_CUTOVER_CONFIRM=1 is set. You review and commit the
               staged deletions yourself.

# npm/yarn install, regenerating the stubs and stripping our blocks; the generated
# ensure-present.sh calls this on post-checkout, so they self-heal on the next
# checkout/pull. Two block kinds, each idempotent (marked, strip-then-insert):
#   fail-closed (pre-commit, pre-push) — runs verify-overlay.sh and blocks when the
#     overlay is gone. ABOVE lefthook on purpose: overlay integrity is not a lefthook
#     check, so LEFTHOOK=0 does not bypass it — the only escape is git's own --no-verify.
#   worktree-bootstrap (post-checkout) — runs ensure-present.sh directly so a fresh
#     `git worktree add` self-heals the harness on ANY host. lefthook no-ops in a fresh
#     worktree (the gitignored config is not there yet), so this self-heal cannot rely on
#     a lefthook job; it lives in the SHARED stub, reachable from every worktree. This is
