#   omakase init you/<name>

# It delegates the capture to import.sh (the deterministic "read a repo's scattered harness
# into payload/" step) and adds the scaffolding + a ready-to-push git repo on top.

A personal [omakase](https://github.com/yuncun/omakase-harness) harness — agent
instructions, lint config, and git-hook gates, overlaid onto any repo with zero
committed footprint.

## Install
