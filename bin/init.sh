Overlay payload/ into the current repo additively (zero committed footprint) and
install lefthook hooks. A payload path the repo already COMMITS is never touched:
it is skipped and reported.

  --source <git-url|path>
               pull a harness SOURCE — a git repo carrying a payload/ tree plus an
               omakase.manifest (flat key: value; name required, version + recommends optional) —
               into a local cache (${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/omakase/sources) and
               inject its payload. The source is remembered; a later bare init.sh
               refreshes and re-injects the same source.
  --cut-over   also untrack (git rm --cached) every payload path the repo currently
               commits, so the injected copies take over. This STAGES DELETIONS of
               shared files; the next commit applies them for everyone. It prints
               exactly what it will untrack and the consequences, then REFUSES
               unless OMAKASE_CUTOVER_CONFIRM=1 is set. You review and commit the
               staged deletions yourself.

# ---- hook stub blocks (install-guards.sh) ----
# install-guards.sh inserts our blocks into the shared hook stubs ABOVE lefthook's own
# call, so none of them depends on a worktree-local lefthook config (gitignored, hence
# absent in a fresh worktree). It is a SCRIPT in the shared git dir, not inline code,
# because lefthook's npm package runs `lefthook install -f` in its postinstall on EVERY
# npm/yarn install, regenerating the stubs and stripping our blocks; the generated
# ensure-present.sh calls this on post-checkout, so they self-heal on the next
# checkout/pull. Two block kinds, each idempotent (marked, strip-then-insert):
#   fail-closed (pre-commit, pre-push) — runs verify-overlay.sh and blocks when the
#     overlay is gone. ABOVE lefthook on purpose: overlay integrity is not a lefthook
#     check, so LEFTHOOK=0 does not bypass it — the only escape is git's own --no-verify.
#   worktree-bootstrap (post-checkout) — runs ensure-present.sh directly so a fresh
#     `git worktree add` self-heals the harness on ANY host. lefthook no-ops in a fresh
#     worktree (the gitignored config is not there yet), so this self-heal cannot rely on
#     a lefthook job; it lives in the SHARED stub, reachable from every worktree. This is
#     the host-agnostic backstop to the Claude-native .worktreeinclude copy: Claude keeps
#     its eager copy, every other host (Copilot CLI, bare git) gets the same result here.
#     Best-effort — it never blocks a checkout (the pre-push fail-closed guard backstops).
#     The lefthook post-checkout job is kept too: it is the re-arm trigger in the main
#     checkout after `lefthook install -f`.
# All blocks are inert once the harness is removed ($COMMON/omakase deleted).
