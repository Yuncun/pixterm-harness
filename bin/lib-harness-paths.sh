# omakase-harness — the single source of truth for "which repo paths are agent-harness
# artifacts, and what kind each is." Sourced by init.sh (records the kind in the provenance
# ledger), show.sh (inventory + committed-surface scan), and import.sh (capture locations).
# NOT executed directly: defines one function + three path lists and runs nothing at source
# time. Safe under the callers' `set -euo pipefail` — the arrays are never empty, so there
# is no unbound-array expansion under bash 3.2 + set -u.
#
# omakase itself is host-agnostic: it injects whatever a payload contains and never branches
# on "which agent." This table is the ONLY place that encodes a specific agent's on-disk
# layout, and it encodes them all at once — there is no per-host mode. Supporting another
# agent (Cursor, Gemini, …) = add its rows below; nothing else in the engine changes.

#   GitHub Copilot CLI : .github/{skills,instructions,prompts,chatmodes,hooks}, .github/copilot-instructions.md
#       (Copilot CLI loads project skills from .github/skills live from disk — see
#        https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-skills.

# bash-3.2 safe (macOS ships 3.2): plain indexed arrays only — no associative arrays.

# kind_of: classify a harness path by its location — the path IS the classification.
# Order matters only between the specific patterns and the catch-alls (*/*, *.md, *): every
# specific pattern below is mutually disjoint, so their order RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER is free.
# Valid kinds: rule skill command agent prompt config doc gate other.
# INVARIANT: every dir named in HARNESS_LOC_DIRS (except .omakase, omakase's own mixed
# plumbing dir) must classify to a kind other than 'other' — harness-paths.test.sh enforces it.
