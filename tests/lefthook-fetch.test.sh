# resolution gains a 4th tier — a pinned, checksum-verified lefthook binary
# fetched into a per-machine cache when lefthook is absent everywhere else.
#   L1. platform -> asset-name mapping (uname tokens -> lefthook's OS/ARCH)
#   L2. fetch happy path — download (from a fixture base URL, no network) ->
#       verify sha256 -> chmod +x -> atomic move into the cache; binary reused
#   L3. checksum mismatch is REJECTED — nothing cached, resolve_lefthook fails
#   L4. graceful fallback through init.sh — fetch fails, init exits non-zero
#       with the install guidance and leaves NOTHING half-installed
#   L5. remove.sh never fetches but DOES use an already-cached binary
#   L6. (opt-in, OMAKASE_TEST_LIVE_FETCH=1) one real download from GitHub
# HOME and XDG_CACHE_HOME point at fixture dirs so nothing touches the real machine.
